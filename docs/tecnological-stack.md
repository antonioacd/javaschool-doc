# Implemented Technologies

This web application is developed with a powerful combination of technologies, seamlessly integrating both backend and frontend components for a cohesive user experience.

## Backend
- **Java**: Empowering the server-side logic, Java brings reliability and versatility to the application's core functionality.
- **Maven**: Serving as our project management and build tool, Maven streamlines the development process and ensures project consistency.
- **Spring Boot**: Driving the backend architecture, Spring Boot simplifies the development of robust and scalable applications.

## Frontend
- **Node.js**: Fueling our frontend ecosystem, Node.js enables a responsive and efficient application, optimizing the user interface.
- **React**: At the heart of our frontend development, React provides a declarative and component-based structure, enhancing code maintainability.
- **JavaScript**: The language of the web, JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to create a lively user interface.

Together, this technological symphony creates a powerful, user-centric web application, combining the reliability of Java and Spring Boot on the backend with the dynamism and responsiveness of Node.js, React, and JavaScript on the frontend.
