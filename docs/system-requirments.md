# Technical Requirements

## Multi-User Client-Server Architecture
- Develop a multi-user client-server application to facilitate communication between multiple clients and a central server.
- Ensure concurrent access by multiple users, optimizing data handling and synchronization.

## Network Connection
- Establish a robust network connection mechanism using industry-standard protocols.
- Ensure reliable data transmission between the client and the server.

## Centralized Data Storage
- Store all application data on the server side for centralized and consistent data management.
- Implement secure data storage practices to protect sensitive information.

## Client-Side Graphical Interface
- Design and implement a user-friendly graphical interface for the client application.
- Ensure an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.

## Data Upload and Synchronization
- Allow clients to upload data to the server and synchronize changes in real-time.
- Implement a reliable synchronization mechanism to handle conflicts and maintain data consistency.

## Error Handling for Hardware and Software Issues
- Implement robust error-handling mechanisms on both client and server sides.
- Provide informative error messages for users and log detailed error information for troubleshooting.
- Include failover mechanisms to handle network interruptions or server downtimes gracefully.

## Security Measures
- Incorporate encryption protocols to secure data during transmission.
- Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access.

## Scalability and Performance
- Design the application for scalability to accommodate an increasing number of users.
- Optimize performance for responsiveness, especially with large datasets or high user volumes.
